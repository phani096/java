Sum of numbers divisible by 3 and 5
In this program, you are required to implement this function: int SumNumbersDivisible (int m, int n); The function accepts 2 positive integers ‘m’ and ‘n’ as its arguments. You are required to calculate the sum of numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, between ‘m’ and ‘n’. Include the starting range, exclude the ending range and return the same.



Format:

Input:

The first line consists of an integer value m.

The second line consists of an integer value n.

Output:

We have to obtain the output, that is the sum of the divisible by both 3 and 5.



Constraint:

0 < m <= n



Example:

Input:

12

50

Output:

90

Explanation:

The numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, between 12 and 50 are {15, 30, 45} and their sum is 90.

CODE:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(sumNumbersDivisible(m, n));
    }
    public static int sumNumbersDivisible(int m, int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = m; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
