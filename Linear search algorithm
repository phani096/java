Linear search algorithm
Write a program to implement a Linear searching algorithm for searching an element in an array.



Format:

Input:

The first line corresponds to the size of an array.

The second line corresponds to the elements in an array.

The third input corresponds to an element that has to be searched.

Output:

If the searching element is present in the array. Print the number along with the location, Eg:" 10 is present at location 6". Otherwise, print "Not found".



Example:

Input:

6

11 15 26 38 9 10

10 

Output:

10 is present at location 6.

CODE:
import java.util.*;
class Main
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    int n=sc.nextInt();
    int a[]=new int[n];
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
      a[i]=sc.nextInt();
    } 
    int x=sc.nextInt();
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
      if(x==a[i])	{
        System.out.println(x+" is present at location "+(i+1)+".");
      	return;
      }
    }
    System.out.println("Not found");
  }
}
